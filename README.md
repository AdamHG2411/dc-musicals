# Project
This is a simple single-page application for finding info on upcoming musical performances in the DC area. It's not comprehensive. I only listed performances I found quickly through a Google Search.

Be patient while it loads. The back-end is hosted on Heroku and it takes a few seconds to wake up.

## Purpose
I built this app as a simple front-end for my second General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive project. The project was to build an API, but I decided to start learning React and build a user interface for accessing the data. I am going to try to keep this up to date for any other musical fans in the DC area, but no guarantees.

## Instructions
Wait for Heroku to wake up and fetch data from the database, then click and upcoming performance for more details and a Spotify widget for playing the soundtrack. I'll include links to purchase tickets where available. An earlier version of this app listed ticket prices. Those have been removed as prices can fluctuate quite a bit and I'm not keeping tabs on them.
